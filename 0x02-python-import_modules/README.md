# 0x02. PYTHON - IMPORT & MODULES

Welcome to the 0x02. Python - import & modules directory! This directory contains a set of tasks designed to help you practice and enhance your Python programming skills. Each task is described below, along with its corresponding solution.

## Task 0: Importing a Simple Function

In this task, you will learn how to import a function from a separate Python file and use it to perform a basic addition operation.

**Instructions:**
- Import the function `add(a, b)` from the file `add_0.py`.
- Assign the values 1 and 2 to variables `a` and `b`, respectively.
- Use these variables as arguments when calling the imported `add` function.
- Print the result of the addition in the format: `<a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value>`.

Solution: See `0-add.py` for the code.

## Task 1: My First Toolbox!

In this task, you will import multiple functions from a file and perform various mathematical operations using those functions.

**Instructions:**
- Import the functions `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `div` from the file `calculator_1.py`.
- Assign the values 10 and 5 to variables `a` and `b`, respectively.
- Use these variables as arguments when calling the imported functions.
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Print the results of these operations.

Solution: See `1-calculation.py` for the code.

## Task 2: How to Make a Script Dynamic!

In this task, you will create a script that prints the number of arguments passed to it and lists those arguments.

**Instructions:**
- Use the `argv` list to access command-line arguments.
- Print the number of arguments.
- For each argument, print its position and value.

Solution: See `2-args.py` for the code.

## Task 3: Infinite Addition

In this task, you will create a program that calculates and prints the sum of all provided arguments.

**Instructions:**
- Use the `argv` list to access command-line arguments.
- Convert arguments to integers using `int()` and calculate their sum.
- Print the sum of the arguments.

Solution: See `3-infinite_add.py` for the code.

## Task 4: Who Are You?

In this task, you will create a program that prints the names defined in a compiled module.

**Instructions:**
- Import the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.
- Print each defined name in alphabetical order (excluding names that start with '__').

Solution: See `4-hidden_discovery.py` for the code.

## Task 5: Everything Can Be Imported

In this task, you will import a variable from an external file and print its value.

**Instructions:**
- Import the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py`.
- Print the value of the imported variable.

Solution: See `5-variable_load.py` for the code.
