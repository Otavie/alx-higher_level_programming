# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

This repository contains tasks related to JavaScript focusing on objects, scopes, and closures.

## Tasks

### 0. Rectangle #0
Create an empty class `Rectangle` using class notation.

**File:** `0-rectangle.js`

### 1. Rectangle #1
Define a class `Rectangle` with a constructor that takes two arguments, `w` and `h`, and initializes the `width` and `height` attributes.

**File:** `1-rectangle.js`

### 2. Rectangle #2
Enhance the `Rectangle` class to handle cases where `w` or `h` are zero or negative by creating an empty object.

**File:** `2-rectangle.js`

### 3. Rectangle #3
Add a method `print()` to the `Rectangle` class that prints the rectangle using the character 'X'.

**File:** `3-rectangle.js`

### 4. Rectangle #4
Expand the `Rectangle` class with two new methods:
- `rotate()` to swap the width and height of the rectangle.
- `double()` to double the width and height of the rectangle.

**File:** `4-rectangle.js`

### 5. Square #0
Create a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` (from `4-rectangle.js`). The constructor takes one argument `size`.

**File:** `5-square.js`

### 6. Square #1
Extend the `Square` class to include a method `charPrint(c)` that prints the square using the character `c`, defaulting to 'X' if `c` is undefined.

**File:** `6-square.js`

### 7. Occurrences
Write a function `nbOccurences` that returns the number of occurrences of a specific element in a list.

**File:** `7-occurrences.js`

### 8. Esrever
Create a function `esrever` that returns the reversed version of a list without using the built-in `reverse` method.

**File:** `8-esrever.js`

### 9. Log me
Implement a function `logMe` that prints the number of arguments already printed and the current argument value.

**File:** `9-logme.js`

### 10. Number conversion
Write a function `converter` that converts a number from base 10 to another base specified as an argument. 

**File:** `10-converter.js`

### 11. Factor index
Develop a script that imports an array from `100-data.js` and computes a new array where each value is multiplied by its index in the original array. Print both the original and new arrays.

**File:** `100-map.js`

### 12. Sorted occurrences
Create a script that imports a dictionary of occurrences from `101-data.js` and generates a dictionary where keys are occurrence counts and values are lists of user ids. Print the new dictionary.

**File:** `101-sorted.js`

### 13. Concat files
Write a script that concatenates two files. The first argument is the path to the first source file, the second argument is the path to the second source file, and the third argument is the destination file path.

**File:** `102-concat.js`
