## 0. Run Python File

Write a Shell script that runs a Python script. The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

**File Name:** 0-run

## 1. Run Inline

Write a Shell script that runs Python code. The Python code will be saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

**File Name:** 1-run_inline

## 2. Hello, Print

Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line. Use the `print` function.

**File Name:** 2-print.py

## 3. Print Integer

Complete this source code to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by "Battery street," followed by a new line. You are not allowed to cast the variable `number` into a string. Your code must be 3 lines long. Use f-strings.

**File Name:** 3-print_number.py

## 4. Print Float

Complete the source code to print the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

**File Name:** 4-print_float.py

## 5. Print String

Complete this source code to print the value of the variable `str` three times, followed by its first 9 characters. The output should follow the specified format. You are not allowed to use loops or conditional statements. Your program should be maximum 5 lines long.

**File Name:** 5-print_string.py

## 6. Play with Strings

Complete this source code to print "Welcome to Holberton School!" without using loops or conditional statements.

**File Name:** 6-concat.py

## 7. Copy - Cut - Paste

Complete this source code to manipulate the variable `word` to generate new variables based on specified conditions. The output should contain substrings of the variable `word`.

**File Name:** 7-edges.py

## 8. Create a New Sentence

Complete this source code to print "object-oriented programming with Python," followed by a new line. You are not allowed to use loops or conditional statements.

**File Name:** 8-concat_edges.py

## 9. Easter Egg

Write a Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, followed by a new line. The script should be limited to 98 characters.

**File Name:** 9-easter_egg.py

## 10. Linked List Cycle

Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

**File Name:** 10-check_cycle.c
**Header File:** lists.h

## 11. Hello, Write

Write a Python script that prints exactly "and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19," followed by a new line. The script should use the `write` function from the `sys` module, print to stderr, and exit with the status code 1.

**File Name:** 100-write.py

## 12. Compile

Write a script that compiles a Python script file. The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable `$PYFILE`. The output filename has to be `$PYFILEc` (e.g., if `$PYFILE=my_main.py`, the output filename will be `my_main.pyc`).

**File Name:** 101-compile

## 13. ByteCode -> Python #1

Write the Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b)` that replicates the functionality of a given Python bytecode.

**File Name:** 102-magic_calculation.py
